Description:

The provided Python script is a web scraper using requests and BeautifulSoup to extract information from a URL (https://miti.co.ke/our-shop/). 
The script targets a website with product listings, and it's designed to scrape and 
store item-image, item-name, and item-price data into an SQLite3 database.

Requesting the Webpage:

It uses the requests library to make a GET request to the specified URL.
Checks if the request was successful (status code 200).

Parsing HTML with BeautifulSoup:

Utilizes BeautifulSoup (bs4) to parse the HTML content of the webpage.

Database Setup:

Connects to an SQLite3 database (items.db) and creates a table (items) if it doesn't exist.
The table has columns for id (auto-incremented), image, name, and price.

Scraping and Inserting Data:

Iterates through each product item on the webpage using appropriate HTML tags and classes.
Extracts the item's image URL, name, and price.
Inserts this data into the SQLite3 database.
